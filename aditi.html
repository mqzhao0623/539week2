        Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found
        wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found
        his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
        personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of
        his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let
        the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the mailman
        and squirrels every single day.

        Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun.
        Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even
        gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
        duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so
        he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.
